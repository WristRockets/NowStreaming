NowStreaming
============

Manage your favorite streamers, get instant notifications when they come online, and much more!

NowStreaming is an extension that will greatly improve the way you manage your favorite Twitch streams.

In addition to having all your favorite streamers in one place, NowStreaming will instantly notify you whenever they go online.

PS: You don't need a Twitch account to use NowStreaming!

First Steps:
- Install the extension! :)
- Go watch a stream on Twitch
- Hit the NowStreaming icon while watching the stream, and click Follow
- That stream will now appear on your NowStreaming popup and you will get notifications everytime it goes online

If you don't want to receive notifications, you can always disable them by right clicking the NowStreaming icon and clicking Options.

Advanced Steps:
- You can import your Twitch following list to Now Streaming!
- Hit the Import from Twitch Button
- Enter your Twitch username
- Submit

Anything you do on NowStreaming *WILL NOT* affect your Twitch account.
